                 THE LEO-II System Distribution

LEO-II is an interactive and automated  higher-order theorem prover for 
classical higher-order logic (simple type theory).


LEO-II Version: v1.1


LEO-II System Requirements:
   LEO-II runs on a regular Unix platform. 
   The following additional software is required:
   - Objective CAML (e.g. Objective Caml version 3.10)
   - GNU bash, version 2.x
   - A First Order Theorem Prover: Currently we recommend:  
      'The E Equational Theorem Prover' which is available at 
      http://www4.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~schulz/WORK/eprover.html


LEO-II Installation: see the file INSTALL


LEO-II command for CASC-22:

Changes in the latest versions:

 v1.1:
  - uses epclextract to generate more concise proof output information in 
    LEO-II's proofs
  - a bug in LEO-II's subformula renaming rules has been detected (thanks to 
    IsabelleN and the THFTPTP infrastructure) and removed
  - the generation of special axioms in the cooperation with first-order 
    provers has been deactivated; the cooperation by default is now using 
    only Hurd's typed translation to first-order.
