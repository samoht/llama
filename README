Tesard is an implemention of a Type and Effect System to Avoid
Race-conditions and Deadlocks.

It is based on Llama-light, an implementation of the Caml programming
language (http://caml.inria.fr/). It incorporates code from the
centrally distributed implementations of Caml.

The file "directories.jpg" shows the dependency graph for directories
