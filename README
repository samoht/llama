Tesard is an implemention of a Type and Effect System to Avoid
Race-conditions and Deadlocks (more details in Gerard Boudol's "A
deadlock-free semantics for shared memory concurrency"
[paper](ftp://ftp-sop.inria.fr/mimosa/personnel/gbo/adfsfsmc.pdf).

It is based on Llama-light, an implementation of the
[Caml](http://caml.inria.fr/) programming language. It incorporates
code from the centrally distributed implementations of Caml.

The file "directories.jpg" shows the dependency graph for directories
containing Caml code.
