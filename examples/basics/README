Three all-time favorites: Fibonacci, Eratosthene's sieve, and the Unix
"wc" utility, presented as standalone programs.

To compile: either "make", or, by hand:

    llamac -o fib fib.ml
    llamac -o wc wc.ml
    llamac -o sieve sieve.ml

To run:

    fib 10              # or some other number
    wc fib.ml           # or some other files
    sieve 1000          # or some other number
