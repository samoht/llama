This directory contains some examples of Caml programs.

The examples can either be compiled and executed as standalone programs
(just type "make" in the subdirectory), or run interactively under
"llama", by executing 
                #use "loadall.ml";;

in the appropriate directory.

Examples marked (*) are taken from the book ``Le langage Caml'', by
Pierre Weis and Xavier Leroy (InterEditions, 1993). Messages and
