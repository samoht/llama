`Tesard` is an implemention of a `Type and Effect System to Avoid
Race-conditions and Deadlocks`. You can find more details in Gerard
Boudol's "A deadlock-free semantics for shared memory concurrency"
[paper](ftp://ftp-sop.inria.fr/mimosa/personnel/gbo/adfsfsmc.pdf).

`Tesard` is based on Llama-light, an implementation of the
[Caml](http://caml.inria.fr/) programming language. It incorporates
code from Objective Caml: for a comparison, please see the "ocaml"
directory.
