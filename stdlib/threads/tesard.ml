(* It is mucho important that the primitives that reschedule are called
   through an ML function call, not directly. That's because when such a
   primitive returns, the bytecode interpreter is only semi-obedient:
   it takes sp from the new thread, but keeps pc from the old thread.
   But that's OK if all calls to rescheduling primitives are immediately
   followed by a RETURN operation, which will restore the correct pc
   from the stack. Furthermore, the RETURNs must all have the same
   frame size, which means that both the primitives and their ML wrappers
   must take exactly one argument. *)
