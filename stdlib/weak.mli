(** Arrays of weak pointers and hash tables of weak pointers. *)


(** {6 Low-level functions} *)

type 'a t
(** The type of arrays of weak pointers (weak arrays).  A weak
   pointer is a value that the garbage collector may erase whenever
   the value is not used any more (through normal pointers) by the
   program.  Note that finalisation functions are run after the
   weak pointers are erased.

   A weak pointer is said to be full if it points to a value,
   empty if the value was erased by the GC.

   Notes:
   - Integers are not allocated and cannot be stored in weak arrays.
   - Weak arrays cannot be marshaled using {!Pervasives.output_value}
     nor the functions of the {!Marshal} module.
*)


val create : int -> 'a t
(** [Weak.create n] returns a new weak array of length [n].
   All the pointers are initially empty.  Raise [Invalid_argument]
   if [n] is negative or greater than {!Sys.max_array_length}[-1].*)

val length : 'a t -> int
(** [Weak.length ar] returns the length (number of elements) of
   [ar].*)

val set : 'a t -> int -> 'a option -> unit
(** [Weak.set ar n (Some el)] sets the [n]th cell of [ar] to be a
   (full) pointer to [el]; [Weak.set ar n None] sets the [n]th
   cell of [ar] to empty.
   Raise [Invalid_argument "Weak.set"] if [n] is not in the range
   0 to {!Weak.length}[ a - 1].*)

val get : 'a t -> int -> 'a option
(** [Weak.get ar n] returns None if the [n]th cell of [ar] is
   empty, [Some x] (where [x] is the value) if it is full.
   Raise [Invalid_argument "Weak.get"] if [n] is not in the range
   0 to {!Weak.length}[ a - 1].*)

val get_copy : 'a t -> int -> 'a option
(** [Weak.get_copy ar n] returns None if the [n]th cell of [ar] is
   empty, [Some x] (where [x] is a (shallow) copy of the value) if
   it is full.
   In addition to pitfalls with mutable values, the interesting
   difference with [get] is that [get_copy] does not prevent
   the incremental GC from erasing the value in its current cycle
   ([get] may delay the erasure to the next GC cycle).
   Raise [Invalid_argument "Weak.get"] if [n] is not in the range
   0 to {!Weak.length}[ a - 1].*)


val check : 'a t -> int -> bool
(** [Weak.check ar n] returns [true] if the [n]th cell of [ar] is
   full, [false] if it is empty.  Note that even if [Weak.check ar n]
   returns [true], a subsequent {!Weak.get}[ ar n] can return [None].*)

val fill : 'a t -> int -> int -> 'a option -> unit
(** [Weak.fill ar ofs len el] sets to [el] all pointers of [ar] from
   [ofs] to [ofs + len - 1].  Raise [Invalid_argument "Weak.fill"]
   if [ofs] and [len] do not designate a valid subarray of [a].*)

val blit : 'a t -> int -> 'a t -> int -> int -> unit
(** [Weak.blit ar1 off1 ar2 off2 len] copies [len] weak pointers
   from [ar1] (starting at [off1]) to [ar2] (starting at [off2]).
   It works correctly even if [ar1] and [ar2] are the same.
   Raise [Invalid_argument "Weak.blit"] if [off1] and [len] do
   not designate a valid subarray of [ar1], or if [off2] and [len]
   do not designate a valid subarray of [ar2].*)
